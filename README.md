#Template Code

Course templates are used to create Flash based eLearning courses. In conjunction with Flash, templates allow developers to create courses and focus on course content.Architecture, course communication, navigation, UI, learning objects, etc. are all built into each template.

## Viewing Files
In order to view the course files, ensure that you have Flash or an IDE like FlashDevelop, Eclipse, WebStorm, etc.

## Usage
When combined with a Flash UI and XML, the template code provides all the functionality to run a course.

Use the .as3proj with FlashDevelop for a quick way to view the files.  Note. This is a small sample of the actual template code.  

```
custom_course.as3proj
```
